# Fox theme fixed

This is fork of [OMZ's fox theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/fox.zsh-theme) with the `â˜®` char replaced by `@`, because in many fonts, there's no monospace "hippe logo" character, so the terminal PS1 looks weird.

# Installation

Use [Antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/)

Add the following line to your plugins file:

```
ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh
Senderman/fox-theme-fixed
```
